## File structure:
- `*.mlx` - live scripts to interactively launch simulations and edit plots
- `*.m` - scripts for simple plots and visualizations
- `functions/` - contains common functions for the models
- `models/` - contains the models themselves

Data gets saved in `data/` and exported plots and videos in `media/`
